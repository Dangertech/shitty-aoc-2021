My (mostly a little bit... eh) solutions for the AdventOfCode 2021


Here, you can see my solutions for the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021">AdventOfCode 2021</a>, solved in C++. 
Some of them probably don't work for you, or don't work for me either (I am currently only missing the solution for Day 3 Part 2).

This git repo is basically only here for three reasons:

- Have a version control system, so that if I fuck up, I don't fuck up everything
- Show that GitHub contribution graph that I'm in fact *not* slacking off 
  <br> (I am a sucker for this graph and it hurts my soul to see it empty)
- To fill the void called my profile page with some things for people to look at

Please note: **I would never, NEVER EVER, use such shitty code in a large project or a production project**.
I solve these in my spare time and try to get them done as fast as possible. They are largely uncommented and probably inefficient.
So no, please don't copy my code. If I managed to solve the AoC problem, you can too.
